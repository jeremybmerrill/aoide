A script for generating arbitrary poems from "found" lines in a given input text.

  "popular sources" list
  allows easy "another poem" button
  maybe: pickle the giant dicts for source/format combos.
design
  put each stanza of longer poems in their own <p>
  keep header on top? (fixed position?)
  fancy format for free verse, limit length on free verse lines

write algorithm post


sum shares as votes? (hard.)

better rime comparison (e.g. working in stress, don't approve "very" and "Peggy" but do approve "he" and "Peggy")

retain apostrophes, quotes, etc. somehow (when are they actually missing?)


maybe:
-------
voting?
users
  profiles
class-based views (more pythonic!!)
