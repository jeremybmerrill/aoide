A script for generating arbitrary poems from "found" lines in a given input text.

  source page? 
  	automatically load that source into new.html partial?
  	source page has format selector? (just a new page with the title, not the text)
  allows easy "another poem" button
design
  put each stanza of longer poems in their own <p>
  keep header on top? (fixed position?)
  fancy format for free verse, limit length on free verse lines


denormalize DB to keep a poem_count on sources?
is beautiful soup too heavy for just finding a title?
sum shares as votes? (hard.)


better rime comparison (e.g. working in stress, don't approve "very" and "Peggy" but do approve "he" and "Peggy")


write algorithm post


retain apostrophes, quotes, etc. somehow (when are they actually missing?)


maybe:
-------
voting?
users
  profiles
class-based views (more pythonic!!)
